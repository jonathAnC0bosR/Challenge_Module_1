# Challenge Module 1

## Description

This is the Challenge Module 1. Throught the elaboration of this challenge I learned the semantic of the HTML elements, how to provide a clear description of the img elements used with the attribute <alt>. Also refactored both HTML and CSS code. In the HTML added semantic tags and erased the excess of div tags. In the CSS code I put together some selectors that were specifyng the same characteristics to some html tags and classes. 

## Instalation

To see the project working all you need to have is vs code and an internet navigator so you can open the links.

## Usage 

As a marketing agency you can actually give some real usage. You can refactor the code and revamp the content to fit your needs and purposes.
